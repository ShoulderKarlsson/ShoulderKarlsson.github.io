#Who am I?

My name is Axel Karlsson and I'm 22 years old. At the moment I both live and study in Kalmar.
I moved here from a small town that is located on the southern part of lake "VÃ¤nern".
I have always been interested in the tech-field and mostly computers. Internet has
always been very baffling to me and I wanted to learn more about websites and how they work.
When I was enrolling highschool I first started at a school focused on IT. After a
couple of weeks I dropped out because I didn't like the environment of that school and started a more broadsided
program. About a year ago I looked more into coding and read a article about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I thought it was interesting immediately and started doing it as a hobby on the side.

#What do I do?

When I'm not writing about myself in blogs I spend most of my time dedicated to my studies.
Im currently enrolled at Linneus university and studying Web programming.
Whenever I dont study, I like to spend my time with my friends or drink coffe. Very
often, Study, drinking coffe and spending time with my friends comes hand in hand.
